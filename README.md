Plants Vs. Zombies
Varrshitha Kumar

Game Description: 
The player will have to strategically place the plants to stop the zombies from breaking into the house. Once a certain threshold of zombies has been reached, the game will switch to night mode, where the sun generation rate will decrease and increase game difficulty. Based on the state of the plants, more advanced zombies will be introduced based on an AI generation of zombies. This identifies weaknesses in the Plant’s defense, such as rows with most and least amount of plants as well as tie cases. Plants can be removed and upgraded, and planted if there is enough sun cost. To win the game, the player must kill the Flag Zombie, which is the leader of the zombie hoard. If the Zombies make it into the house, the player loses the game.
